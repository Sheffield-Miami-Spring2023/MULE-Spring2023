## Timeline
- Week 8 - Pi testing deadline, Poster deadline
- Week 9 - Spring Break
- Week 10 - software/score freeze
- Week 14 - Concert

## General
- Raspberry Pis
	- Lead: Eric first, then Bennett helps
	- PD audio needs to be fixed before testing
	- Audio interfaces need to be tested

## Handbells
- Lead: volunteers?
- Size of group: 6-7 people (whoever is not on bass drum piece)
- Next steps:
	- Read through pitch sequences
	- Discuss instrument interface - could this be a good option for the Building Interactive Devices class?
	- Talk about feasibility of device building w/ Dr. Weisling (Eric will do this)
	- Create phone-based prototype interface (Eric will do this)
- Ideas:
	- Side-to-side motions for sample scrubbing (wiki-wiki)
	- Think about the instruments design as “hyper handbells”
	- Reversed sounds with reversed bell motion
	- Polyrhythmic material (2 on 3, 3 on 4, etc)
	- Pitch sequences
		- Bennet: F#-G#-A#-B-A#-F#-G#
		- Catherine: B-C-D-D#-F#

## Bass Drum
- Lead: Ethan
- Size of group: 3-4 players
- Next steps:
	- Create feedback control mappings (use MIDI keyboards in cabinet)
		- What controls will the players have at their disposal?
		- Is there a 1-to-1 mapping option for trackpad? (Eric will look into this)
	- Experiment with a protoype system to assemble a vocabulary of sounds/gestures
	- Test w/ better transducer, the amps should be powerful enough (is Ethan buying these?)
	- Figure out how to incorporate multiple individuals/feedback systems
	- Think about notation
	- Possibly motions similar to the bass drum head rubbing/scratching?
- Ideas:
	- Primarily lower frequencies and rumbles (filters are good for this)

## Light Partials
- Lead: Reese
- Size of group: all 10 players
- Next steps:
	- Develop p5-based patch (Eric will do this)
	- Add ability to call the partials requested by the score (should this just be frequency?)
	- Create a working score with partials numbered and clear instructions of how to play/the patch (Reese, with ensemble input)
	- Will there be assigned parts? Composing which partials are allowed for each sub unit, played at will based on position of light
- Ideas:
	- Some kind of attractor or flocking behavior for nodes - boids? (Eric will look into this)
	- Bubbles appear and move in sync with the frequencies allowed in the score (what does this mean?)
	- Spreadsheet with time and allowed frequencies (used to generate score)
	- Ensemble members will advance through the sections themselves

## In C
- Lead: Eric
- Size of group: all 10 players
- Next steps:
	- Make list of good vs. bad synths
	- Figure out how to do global synth parameter adjustment (as opposed to note-by-note)
	- Construct and share all 51 patterns
	- How to share?
	- How to distribute workload?
	- Recruit 3-4 acoustic performers (Eric will do this, though ensemble members are welcome to offer suggestions)
	- Refresher for all the coding
	- Look for samples in the sonic pi that could be useful
- Ideas:
