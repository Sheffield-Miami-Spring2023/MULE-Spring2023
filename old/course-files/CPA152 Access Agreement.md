By submitting this assignment, I agree to the following conditions regarding CPA152 access:
1. I will not give the door code to anyone else nor save or post it to any other location (e.g. Google Docs, Discord, etc).
2. I will use the [MUCaT Studios Skedda](https://mucatstudios.skedda.com) calendar to reserve a time if I want to access the space outside of regular MULE meeting times.
3. I will check the [Music Department events calendar](https://www.miamioh.edu/cca/academics/departments/music/performances/performance-calendar/index.html) to ensure that there is not an event scheduled in Souers before reserving a time on the Skedda calendar. I understand that the space is not available during these scheduled events as the studio is needed for recording and streaming.
4. I will be respectful of any unscheduled events in Souers (e.g. impromptu rehearsals). This includes keeping volume levels to a minimum and quietly entering through Souers.
5. I will NOT use any of the Dolby Atmos Studio equipment unless I have already had an orientation session with Dr. Sheffield.
6. I will ensure that equipment and room orientation are restored to the standard configuration before leaving.
7. I will email Dr. Sheffield ASAP if I find that any equipment is missing or broken.
8. I will not bring any food or drink into CPA152 other than water in a resealable bottle.
9. I will not bring any non-MULE members into CPA152 with me unless given explicit permission by Dr. Sheffield via email.
10. I understand that these conditions may change at any time in response to future needs or concerns.
