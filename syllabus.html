Students will gain an understanding of how to use computers and other emerging music technologies to create music in an ensemble environment. Additionally, they will develop music industry strategies for ensemble development, such as publicity, booking, and promoting music.</p>

<section id="course-policies">

  <h2 style="background: #C41230; color: #ffffff; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1;">Course Policies</h2>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">This syllabus is intended to give you a general overview of the policies, procedures, and content for the semester. While it will be followed as closely as possible, the instructor reserves the right to modify or supplement it as needed. All changes will be posted to Canvas.</p>

  <div id="general">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">General Information and Expectations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not think that you can adhere to the policies and expectations of this course as outlined in the syllabus and on Canvas, I recommend withdrawing before <a href="https://miamioh.edu/academic-calendar/2022-2023/index.html" target="_blank">important deadlines</a> have passed. Likewise, I may "force drop" any student that has missed an inordinate amount of coursework. Advance notice will be provided via email in these situations.</li>
      <li>I am always willing to listen, but some situations, academic or otherwise, may exceed the scope of my abilities or responsibilities. In these circumstances, I encourage you to seek assistance from campus resources (e.g. tutoring, counseling services, disability services, etc) - see relevant links at the end of this document.</li>
      <li>Depending on your specific circumstances, living independently may still be a new experience at this time in your life. You are the primary advocate for your physical and mental health. Eat well, stay hydrated, and get enough rest.</li>
      <li>Concert etiquette:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You are expected to perform in all required concerts and arrive at the designated concert call times.</li>
        <li>Concert dress is generally informal. No holes, no shorts, yes shoes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Rehearsal etiquette:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You are expected to arrive to every reahearsal/meeting on time AND have your personal performance setup ready within the first 5 minutes of class.</li>
        <li>We will cover general settings and startup procedures during the first weeks of the semester.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <div id="communication">
    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Communication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You are expected to regularly check Canvas Announcements, our Discord channel, and your <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/policy-library/students/undergraduate/academic-regulations/student-email-policy.html" target="_blank">Miami email</a> inbox.</li>
      <li>Use email for any correspondence that warrants documentation (e.g. excused absences, grading errors or disputes, etc). Send all email messages from your miamioh.edu account. Include the course number and section in the subject line and provide sufficient information so that I can formulate a helpful response (e.g. things like dates and times, specific software applications, error messages, assignment titles, file formats, etc).</li>
      <li>Use the #mule channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/r9mjs99pzJ" target="_blank">Music Comp/Tech Discord server</a> for informal chat, quick questions, peer assistance, and brainstorming.</li>
      <li>I will usually reply fairly quickly to emails or Discord messages during regular business hours (M-F 9:00am-5:00pm), but please allow up to 2 business days for a response.</li>
      <li>I am always happy to help, but before you email with a question, check to see if the answer is already on Canvas or in this syllabus. I also encourage you to just try a quick Google search. Sometimes, the information you need can be surprisingly easy to find, and solving small problems through self-directed research is an indispensable skill.</li>
      <li>My office hours are only by appointment via <a href="https://calendar.app.google/J7pZwWrvF4vkoQ4w5" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>. This provides the greatest flexibility to meet everyone's scheduling needs. By default, all office hours meetings will occur online using the Google Meet link attached to the booking.</li>
    </ul>

  <div id="technology">

    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Technology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I am not tech support. There are on-campus and manufacturer resources available to help with personal software and hardware.</li>
      <li>I expect that you will keep crucial personal technology (i.e. laptops) in working order for the duration of the semester or make alternate arrangements if needed (e.g. <a href="https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/technology/tech-checkout/" target="_blank">borrow a loaner from King</a>).</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div id="attendance">
    <h3 style="background: #EDECE2; text-indent: .5ch; position: sticky; top: 2.4rem;">Attendance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Required concerts:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>ETBD Student Expo - Wednesday, May 3, 6:00pm, LAWS Hall second floor (call time TBD) </li>
        <li>MULE Concert - TBD</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Attendance and participation are effectively the only things that directly affect your grade in this ensemble. As such, attendance will be taken during every meeting.</li>
      <li>Absences for reasonable circumstances will be excused as long as the instructor is notified via email before class.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Examples of reasonable circumstances include: an illness, religious observances, a death in the family, a car accident, a university-sanctioned event (with documentation), etc.</li>
        <li>Examples of unreasonable circumstances include: a job interview, a vacation, oversleeping, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>You are allowed 2 unexcused absences without penalty. After the first 2, any additional unexcused absence will drop your final grade by a +/- increment (approximately 3%).</li>
      <li>3 unexcused late arrivals will count as 1 unexcused absence.</li>
      <li>An unexcused absence from a concert will result in an automatic F for the semester.</li>
      <li>Do not come to class sick. Stay home to rest and avoid sharing germs with your classmates and instructors (especially COVID-19).</li>
    </ul>
